The following is a repository of code utilised in the second half of my bachelor's thesis entitled "Statistical Shape Modeling of Femurs". The code is concerned with the 'nodal approach' of developing a statistical shape model (SSM) of a dataset of femurs. 

Although it was concluded in the thesis (included in the repository) that the nodal approach did not effectively capture the fine geometrical variation of femurs, nevertheless the code may serve relevant for future projects involving SSM generation utilising the Scalismo library https://github.com/unibas-gravis/scalismo in Scala.
